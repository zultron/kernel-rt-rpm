This is a fork of the ELRepo kernel-ml git repository, patched for the
Xenomai real time framework.

The package requires the xenomai-devel package for the Xenomai
patches.

To build in OBS, edit the [project configuration][1]:

    osc meta prjconf -e

And ensure the `kernel-headers` package is installed and
`kernel-xenomai-headers` is ignored:

    %if 0%{?fedora} || 0%{?rhel_version} || 0%{?centos_version}
    # Keep kernel-headers package when building kernel
    Keep: kernel-headers
    Support: kernel-headers
    Prefer: -kernel-xenomai-headers
    %endif
