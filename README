This is a fork of the ELRepo kernel-ml git repository, patched for the
Xenomai real time framework.

Only el6 is supported.  The package requires the xenomai-devel package
for the Xenomai patches.

This package is experimental.  After any new build or install on any
new machine, please run the regression tests:

sudo xeno-regression-test -l "/usr/lib64/xenomai/dohell \
        -m /tmp 100" -t 2

Be sure to check dmesg for kernel OOPSes or any problems
